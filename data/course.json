These quality characteristics are to be made robust to noise affecting the system.\n*   Sythesize and select design concepts for robustness.\n*   Identify noise factors whose variation may affect the quality characteristics.\n*   Estimate the robustness of any given design (experimentally and analytically).\n*   Formulate and implement methods to reduce the effects of noise (parameter design, active control, adjustment).\n*   Select rational tolerances for a design.\n*   Explain the role of robust design techniques within the wider context of the product development process.\n*   Lead product development activities that include robust design techniques.\n",
