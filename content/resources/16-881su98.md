description: A key concept of the course is that in order to reduce quality loss (black
  line) in systems exhibiting a lot of variation (red distribution), it is important
  to first reduce variation (blue distribution) and also to place the distribution
  on target (green distribution).  (Graph by Prof. Daniel Frey.)
